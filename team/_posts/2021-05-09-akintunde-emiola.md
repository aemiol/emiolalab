I received my Masterâ€™s and Ph.D. degrees in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, respectively, from the University of East London, United Kingdom. My graduate studies focused on developing computational kinetic models to study bacterial pathway dynamics, with the goal of identifying suitable drug targets. My work led to the discovery of a potent antimicrobial molecule which served as the basis for the establishment of a biotech company. 

I received a highly selective JAX Scholar award for my postdoctoral training at the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, USA, to conduct research on the microbiome where I developed computational tools and pipelines to analyze metagenomics datasets. Most recently, my work focused on developing approaches to characterize total nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) from single microbial cells for high-throughput identification of novel antibiotics. My effort in this area was rewarded with an NIH K99 Pathway to Independence award. In 2021, I was appointed as a Stadtman Investigator at NIDCR.
