# About This Site

## Purpose
This website is intended to communicate the scientific vision and work of the barthel lab with prospective team members, patients, funding agencies, press and others who may be interested. We welcome questions, comments, feedback and suggestions and encourage anyone to reach out with us directly [here](/contact/).

## Source code and design
The site borrows code from that of [Trevor Bedford](https://github.com/blab/blotter) deployed at [bedford.io](http://bedford.io). Elements of the design were adopted from the [Riggleman lab website](http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu/publications/) and the [Drummond Lab website](http://drummondlab.org/). Many thanks to [Samir Amin](https://sbamin.com/) for many tips and feedback while designing this site, including but not limited to adding Twitter Cards and Opengraph support. 

Updates are pushed to Github and continously built and deployed online via the (free) [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) service. Like its precursors, the source code for this site is publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/fpbarthel/barthel-lab) and is placed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/fpbarthel/barthel-lab#license). If you end up using any elements unique to this implementation, I'd love to hear about it so please [reach out to let me know](https://www.barthel-lab.com/team/floris-barthel/) and/or drop a link back to [barthel-lab.com](https://www.barthel-lab.com/)!
