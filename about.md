# Purpose
We built this website to facilitate communication of our research with those interested including prospective team members, patients, funding agencies, press and members of the general public. Good science communication is essential to maximize its impact on human health and through this platform we are taking a proactive stance. We welcome questions, comments, feedback and suggestions and encourage anyone to reach out to Floris directly [here](/team/floris-barthel/).

# Design
This website was inspired by and borrows source code from Trevor Bedfordâ€™s [lab website](https://bedford.io/), who has made the code publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/blab/blotter). The publication list was inspired by that of the [Riggleman lab](http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu/publications/). The vertically aligned feed was inspired by that of the [Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org/), which also makes its code available on [Github](https://github.com/drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io). In the same spirit of sharing I have made the code for my implementation available [here](https://github.com/fpbarthel/fpbarthel.github.io). If you end up using any of the code, I'd appreciate a link back to me and/or any others that influenced your fork. Happy coding!
