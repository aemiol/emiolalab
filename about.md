# Purpose
We built this website to communicate our research with prospective team members, patients, funding agencies, press and others who may be interested. We welcome questions, comments, feedback and suggestions and encourage anyone to reach out to Floris directly [here](/team/floris-barthel/).

# Design
This website was inspired by and borrows source code from Trevor Bedfordâ€™s [lab website](https://bedford.io/), who has made the code publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/blab/blotter). The publication list was inspired by that of the [Riggleman lab](http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu/publications/). The vertically aligned feed was inspired by that of the [Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org/), which also makes its code available on [Github](https://github.com/drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io).
